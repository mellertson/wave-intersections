# Overview

This is a curiosity project, which I threw toghter.  It allows you to visualize 
how waves from multiple wave generators interfere with each other.  The 
original idea behind this repo was to see how high frequency waves 
from Tesla coils might interact with each other. 

# Install

You will need Python 3 installed.  Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to use

There are some variables at the top of `main.py`, which you can "twiddle". 
Then just execute `main.py`.  A separate PNG file will be saved to the 
project's root directory with a filename like the following.

`waves-#_sides-#_hertz-#.png`

# Example Output

Here are a few of my favorited images, which it generated.  

This one shows a _V_ patter at the top and bottom, which looks like a pattern
I saw formed from very small waves while the wave was washing back out into
the ocean a few weeks ago. Seeing those patterns in the ocean was part of the
reason I wrote this code.  I was hoping to reproduce those same patters, which 
I have done in this image.

This one just looks cool.  You can change the colors around if it is 
difficult to look at.

This one has some interesting looking color streaks, which seem to bend
slightly.
